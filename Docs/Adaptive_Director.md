# Adaptive HypnoDirector 2.0

This document integrates the HypnoDirector 2.0 system’s semantic vector space navigation with the adaptive content strategies, state tracking, and A/B testing methods. Together, they create an intelligent director capable of guiding a hypnosis session through evolving thematic content, adjusting in real-time based on the listener’s psychological state, and continuously refining the content selection for maximum effectiveness.

## Overview

The Adaptive HypnoDirector 2.0 orchestrates thematic hypnosis lines throughout a session. Instead of purely random selection, it uses semantic embeddings to navigate a vector space of content. It also tracks user states (arousal, focus, depth) and adapts the session dynamically, ensuring the narrative remains coherent, personalized, and continuously optimized.

**Key Goals:**
- Start from a chosen initial theme and guide the user towards a target “goal theme” or end-state.
- Adapt the intensity, theme focus, and suggestion style based on real-time measurements of user arousal, focus, and depth of trance.
- Use A/B testing strategies to empirically identify which lines and themes have the most profound effect on the user, refining content choices over time.

## Key Concepts

### Themes
- **Definition**: Themes are conceptual categories (e.g., `acceptance`, `obedience`, `addiction`) that shape the content of a session.
- **Intensity Levels**: Themes have graded intensities (`BASIC`, `LIGHT`, `MODERATE`, `DEEP`, `EXTREME`) that control how strong or suggestive the lines are.
- **Role in Adaptation**: The system adjusts theme intensity and selection dynamically as the user’s state evolves.

### Semantic Embeddings
- **Purpose**: Each line is converted into a numeric vector using a sentence transformer model, capturing its semantic meaning.
- **Benefit**: By representing lines as points in a high-dimensional space, lines with similar meanings cluster together. This allows the director to find natural transitions without manual linking.

### Vector Space Navigation
- **Start and Goal**: The session begins at a “start line” (e.g., related to acceptance) and aims for a “goal theme” (e.g., obedience).
- **Path Traversal**: Each subsequent line is chosen by finding the vector nearest to the current line that also “moves” closer to the goal.  
- **Constraints**: The traversal respects session structure (e.g., only certain intensities allowed at certain times) and the user’s current states, ensuring a smooth and logical narrative flow.

## Adaptive Content System

While vector space navigation ensures semantic coherence, the Adaptive Content System introduces real-time responsiveness:

### State Tracking
- **Arousal**: Measured via thematic cues and potentially biometric data (e.g., heart rate).
- **Focus**: Estimated by the user’s interaction and the attention-grabbing nature of the current theme.
- **Depth**: Indicates how deeply entranced the user is, often related to how well suggestions and deepeners are working.

### Mechanism of Adaptation
- **Theme Intensity Scaling**: Adjust intensity based on user state; if the user is highly aroused but not deep, the system might introduce calmer themes before intensifying again.
- **Suggestion Modification**: Deepen suggestions as the trance state intensifies.
- **Dynamic Phase Transitioning**: Move between induction, deepeners, and suggestion phases as user states dictate.

### Feedback Loops
- **Real-time Reevaluation**: The director continuously monitors the effectiveness of current lines. If the user’s focus dips, it might switch to more engaging content.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporate user feedback (e.g., button presses, spoken responses, or physiological signals) to refine content choices in real-time.

## A/B Testing Mode

Beyond adapting in the moment, the system also seeks long-term improvement by conducting structured A/B tests:

1. **Selecting Variants**: Choose pairs of similar lines or themes to compare.
2. **Consecutive Testing**: Present these pairs over multiple sessions to different users in a controlled, randomized manner.
3. **State Tracking Feedback**: Analyze changes in arousal, focus, and depth after each variant.
4. **Effectiveness Analysis**: Identify which variants consistently yield stronger positive changes and prioritize them in future sessions.

### Optimization Over Time
Repeated A/B testing allows the system to:
- Identify the most potent themes and lines.
- Refine intensity ramps and path traversal strategies.
- Continuously improve session quality by featuring lines proven to have a greater hypnotic impact.

## How It Works: Combined Flow

1. **Initialization**:
   - Load all lines, themes, intensities, and embeddings.
   - Set a start line/theme and a goal line/theme based on session configuration.
   - Prepare initial A/B test candidates if experimenting with content refinement.

2. **Session Execution**:
   - **Current State**: Begin at the initial line with baseline arousal, focus, and depth estimates.
   - **Next Line Selection**:
     - Use vector similarity to find the next best line, considering the user’s state and the goal theme.
     - Apply filters for intensity and theme constraints.
   - **Adaptive Adjustments**:
     - Monitor user states in real-time.
     - If depth is increasing slowly, add more deepeners or adjust line intensity.
     - If arousal is too high, temporarily introduce calming lines.
   - **A/B Tests**:
     - Occasionally present alternative line variants.
     - Track which variant leads to better user states.
   
3. **Session End**:
   - Once the time limit or the goal theme is reached, end the session on a line representing the final desired state.
   - Incorporate insights gained from A/B tests into the knowledge base for future sessions.

## Configuration Options

- **Session Length**: Total duration or number of lines.
- **Start/Goal Themes**: Thematic start and end points.
- **Intensity Ramp**: How quickly intensity scales throughout the session.
- **Filtering Rules**: Which themes or intensities are allowed or disallowed.
- **Adaptive Sensitivity**: How responsive the system is to state changes.
- **A/B Test Parameters**: How frequently tests are run, criteria for success, and methods for deciding winners.

## Example Use Case

**Scenario**: A 20-minute session from `acceptance` (BASIC) to `obedience` (DEEP).

- Minutes 0-5: Start near acceptance and relaxation lines. User states are stable and calm.
- Minutes 5-10: Move towards themes like trust and openness, adjusting intensity if user depth is low.
- Minutes 10-15: Introduce mild dependency lines. If user focus dips, try a different line variant from A/B testing to recapture engagement.
- Minutes 15-20: Arrive at obedience lines at a higher intensity. If user arousal spikes, slightly soften the last few lines or select variants proven effective for calming.

## Future Extensions

- **Adaptive Responding**: Integrate biometric and environmental data for real-time personalization.
- **Metadata-Aware Search**: Combine semantic similarity with metadata (line length, speaker persona) to refine choices further.
- **Complex Narratives**: Introduce branching paths shaped by user feedback and A/B test results, evolving sessions into dynamic, personalized stories.
