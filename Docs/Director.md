# HypnoDirector 2.0

## Overview
The HypnoDirector 2.0 system orchestrates thematic hypnosis lines throughout a listening session. Instead of randomly selecting lines, it intelligently navigates a semantic vector space to create a coherent narrative flow that guides the listener from an initial theme to a target end-state.

## Key Concepts

### Themes
- **Definition**: A theme is a conceptual category (e.g., `addiction`, `obedience`, `vanity`).
- **Intensity Levels**: Each theme has lines categorized into intensity levels (`BASIC`, `LIGHT`, `MODERATE`, `DEEP`, `EXTREME`).
- **Usage**: Themes define the “content neighborhoods” in the vector space. Early session lines might be lower intensity themes, gradually intensifying as the session progresses.

### Semantic Embeddings
- **Purpose**: Convert lines into a numeric vector representation that captures semantic meaning.
- **Model**: We use a sentence transformer model to generate a high-dimensional vector for each line.
- **Benefit**: Lines with similar meanings cluster together, enabling natural transitions without manual link definitions.

### Vector Space Navigation
- **Start and Goal**: Sessions begin with a chosen “start line” (e.g., related to acceptance or relaxation) and have a “goal theme” (e.g., `obedience` or `slave mentality`).
- **Path Traversal**: At each step, the director selects the next line by finding the vector closest to the current line that also “moves” closer to the goal theme’s centroid or a pre-selected “goal line.”
- **Constraints**: The director respects session structure rules, ensuring intensity rises gradually and the session’s narrative feels coherent.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - The director loads all lines, their themes, intensities, and embeddings.
   - A start line and a goal theme/line are chosen according to the session configuration.

2. **Session Execution**:
   1. **Current State**: The director starts from the initial line.
   2. **Next Line Selection**:
      - The system queries the vector store for lines semantically similar to the current line that also trend towards the goal’s embedding.
      - Filters are applied to ensure intensity and theme constraints.
   3. **Progression**:
      - Over time, the director selects lines that gradually shift semantic space from initial themes to the goal theme.
      - If the session hits intermediate milestones, intensity can be increased.

3. **Session End**:
   - Once the time limit or the thematic goal is reached, the director gracefully ends the session on a line that represents the final thematic state.

## Configuration Options

- **Session Length**: Define total duration or number of lines.
- **Start/Goal Themes**: Select which theme to begin with and where to end.
- **Intensity Ramp**: Control how quickly the director moves through intensity levels.
- **Filtering Rules**: Configure whether certain themes, tags or intensities are off-limits.

## Example Use Case

**Scenario**: We want a session that starts in a calm, reassuring state and ends in a state of deep obedience.

1. **Start Theme**: `acceptance` (BASIC intensity)
2. **Goal Theme**: `obedience` (DEEP intensity)
3. **Session Duration**: 20 minutes
4. **Director Flow**:
   - Minutes 0-5: Lines near acceptance, relaxation.
   - Minutes 5-10: Transition lines found in semantic space near concepts like trust, openness.
   - Minutes 10-15: Move deeper into themes of service, mild dependency.
   - Minutes 15-20: Arrive fully at obedience lines, achieving the goal theme at a higher intensity.

## Future Extensions
- **Adaptive Responding**: Integrate biometric data or user feedback to dynamically adjust the path.
- **Metadata-Aware Search**: Combine semantic similarity with metadata tags (e.g., line length, speaker perspective).
- **More Complex Narrative Structures**: Instead of a linear path, introduce branching logic that can adapt to user actions.
- **Visualization Tools**: Provide a 2d or 3d visual representation of the semantic space and the path taken during a session.
- **User-Defined Themes**: Allow users to define custom themes and integrate them into the director’s decision-making process.
- **Dominant Assisted Mode**: A mode where the another user can guide the director in real time.

By following these guidelines, using embeddings, and managing a session structure, you can create a compelling and adaptive “director” system. This approach should let you produce a more immersive, thematically coherent hypnosis experience as you move through the vector space of suggestive lines.
