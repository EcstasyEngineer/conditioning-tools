#NAME Mirror Veil Induction
#DESCRIPTION
You enter a sacred temple and face a mysterious mirror that distorts reality. This segment introduces the scenario of confusion and transcendence as the goddess’s image emerges from beyond.

The temple’s air is warm and perfumed with incense.
You stand before a tall mirror that doesn’t quite reflect you as you know yourself.
The surface shimmers, your features distorted, unclear.
With each slow breath, the mirror’s haze intensifies, making it hard to remember your own face.

You feel her gentle gaze from beyond the glass.
As you stare, reality softens; you trust the presence you sense behind the veil.
