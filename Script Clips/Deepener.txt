#NAME Deep Focus Fractionation
#DESCRIPTION This deepener takes the subject on a journey of alternating states, oscillating between alertness and deep relaxation. The process enhances focus and builds trust, while reinforcing the idea that obedience to the voice leads to profound tranquility. By guiding the subject up and down, the barriers between wakefulness and trance dissolve, allowing deeper immersion and an effortless acceptance of commands.
I'm going to count down once more from the number 10 to the number 1
with each and every number. You will find yourself focusing more and more,
becoming more and more relaxed, getting closer to that state where you are in your own mind.
When you are in your own mind, nothing can distract you, nothing outside can influence you.
The distracting world around you will be kept away and the only thing to condition
and affect you will be what's in your mind. It will be my voice in your mind,
my voice that you trust, my voice that has helped you relax this much,
my voice that has helped you relax, 10, 9,
8, 7,
10, 6, 5,
4, 3, 2, 1.
Deep in your own mind, completely relaxed.
Deep in your own mind, completely relaxed. No distractions, only my voice, only me.
Your mind feels so very good. You remember this feeling from years ago,
you remember this feeling from before you were a slave to your phone,
before you were focused not on yourself, before you were a slave to notifications,
you remember this feeling from when it was so easy to learn,
you remember this feeling from when it was easy to get lost in a story or a song or someone's voice,
you've missed this feeling so much and you want to stay here in this place where you are relaxed
and focused and you want to take this feeling deeper, you want to fall deeper into this feeling.
We will help you go deeper, you can go deeper. 
When I tell you to, you will rise up out of trance.
You will be wide awake, but focused on my voice.
We will take you up and down, playing with your mind.
Drop deeper, deeper and deeper under my power. 
deeper and deeper into focus. 
you are focused, you are deep. 
Now I'm going to count upwards from the number one to the number three.
when I reach the number three you will rise up out of trance, you will still feel focused, listening intently.
aware of the world around you and you will feel the need to go back down where you are relaxed.
where it feels so good to listen and obey, 
one. two. three wide awake.
focused but aware of the world around you.
aware that there are distractions waiting to invade your mind.
distractions that you want nothing to do with.
And that's why when I count down from number three to the number one, you will go back down deep. 
Your body will relax so pleasantly and you will let my voice take complete control of your mind when you hear me count down from the number three to the number one.
you will drop back down deep, body fully relaxed and focused on my voice.

#NAME Spiral of Surrender
#DESCRIPTION This deepener uses layered suggestions to lead the subject into an intense state of surrender and arousal, linking the act of submission to hypnotic trance. A powerful trigger command, "surrender," is installed, creating a reinforced association between arousal and hypnotic submission. The subject is conditioned to fall deeper into trance with each repetition of the word, amplifying feelings of helplessness and trust while intensifying their need to obey.

#NAME Staircase of Descent
#DESCRIPTION This deepener uses the imagery of descending a staircase to guide the subject deeper into relaxation and compliance, making their mind more open and receptive.
Now that you are comfortably relaxed, imagine a grand staircase spiraling downward into soft, golden light, each step inviting you deeper into calm surrender.
You place your foot on the top step, feeling plush carpet under your toes, and notice how solid and secure it feels.
With each step you descend, your thoughts become quieter, softer, more distant.
Perhaps you can hear a gentle, far-off melody drifting up from below, guiding you downward.
With the next step, allow your shoulders to drop, your arms to hang loosely, every muscle relaxing further.
Another step, and your mind feels heavier and lighter at the same time, as if old worries are melting away, leaving space for soothing emptiness.
As you continue down, you find counting each step relaxing: ten steps down, now nine, now eight.
With each count, your mind drifts twice as deep, leaving behind the surface world.
Seven steps, and you can barely recall what it was like before you began this descent.
Six steps, and the only thing that matters is the tranquility unfolding inside you.
Five steps, and you feel cradled by the soft glow below, as if someone gently supports you.
Four steps, and all tension is gone, replaced with a serene quiet.
Three steps, and you lose track of your surface identity, embracing this relaxed state fully.
Two steps, and you realize how good it feels to have nothing but acceptance in your mind.
One step, almost there, your heart steady, your breathing slow and even.
Finally, you reach the bottom, stepping into a warm, open space, feeling perfectly safe, perfectly receptive.
Here, you are so deep that any words spoken to you now sink effortlessly into the core of your mind.
It feels as if your mind is an open chamber, echoing gently with the commands and truths given to you.
Sink even further into this relaxation, resting comfortably at the bottom of your mind’s staircase.
Now you are prepared to accept suggestions, guidance, or transformations with ease.

#NAME Labyrinth of Simplicity
#DESCRIPTION This deepener guides the subject through a quiet, endless labyrinth, progressively stripping away conscious thoughts and fostering complete compliance.
You find yourself drifting through the corridors of a quiet labyrinth, its walls made of soft, velvety material that gently absorb sound.
Each turn leads you deeper, and with every step you take, your mind empties a little more.
You feel no frustration at being in a maze—only calm curiosity, knowing that each twist and turn guides you to perfect peace.
As you walk, notice how your thoughts slow, as if captured and gently dissolved by the soft walls.
Your breathing becomes so steady, each inhale and exhale matching your slow, unhurried steps.
There is no hurry here; time stretches out softly, allowing you to wander without care.
Each corridor seems more peaceful than the last, more hushed, more soothing.
You might hear a faint hum, a distant tone that vibrates pleasantly within you, easing you deeper.
Turn a corner, and feel a layer of conscious thought peel away, leaving you more open to suggestion.
Turn another corner, and find yourself unable to remember what worried you before.
Another corridor, and words from the outside world seem distant and unimportant, except for the voice guiding you now.
With every step, you become more receptive, your mind like a still pool reflecting only the gentle instructions given.
Deeper and deeper you go, and each new passage makes it easier to surrender.
Soon, you cannot even tell how large the labyrinth is, because all that matters is this journey inward.
You follow the gentle guidance of your own relaxation, each step confirming your compliance.
Eventually, you reach a central chamber—a quiet, open space at the heart of the maze.
Here, it is silent, and yet, not empty—here, subtle truths can nestle into your mind effortlessly.
You rest in this chamber, feeling so calm, so quiet, so willing.
The labyrinth no longer confuses you; it has merely guided you to surrender and stillness.
In this depth, suggestions, commands, and new identities can flow in seamlessly, settling deep within.

#NAME Slow Breathing Focus
#DESCRIPTION This deepener uses controlled breathing to guide the subject deeper into trance, each cycle of breath fostering relaxation and receptivity.
Focus now on the rhythm of your breath, each inhale drawing you further inward, each exhale releasing resistance.
Begin by inhaling slowly, counting silently to four, holding that calm air inside a moment, and then exhaling slowly to a count of four.
With the next breath, imagine the air you draw in is a soft, silver mist that soothes and relaxes every fiber of your being.
As you exhale, imagine any remaining tension leaving your body in dark, fading wisps.
Continue this cycle: inhale calm and peace, exhale tension and worry.
With each breath, your mind becomes clearer, more open, more pliant.
Inhale slowly, feeling a gentle warmth spreading through your chest and into your limbs.
Exhale, feeling your body become heavier, resting more completely against the surface that supports you.
Each cycle of breath takes you deeper, like traveling down a gentle slope into a valley of tranquility.
As you continue, the world outside fades, and only the sound and feel of your breathing remains.
Your muscles relax further with each breath, like a ripple of calm flowing through you.
The quiet in your mind expands, making room for new truths to settle in.
You sense your thoughts drifting off, like leaves on a stream, leaving only a smooth current of emptiness behind.
There is no need to resist or control this process—your breath leads the way, guiding you gently downward.
The longer you maintain this rhythm, the deeper you sink, the quieter your inner voice becomes.
Soon, even the counting fades, replaced by a natural ease, a silent trust in the process.
Your mind is now so open and receptive, every suggestion can slip in effortlessly.
It feels as though you have reached a calm, still lake in the center of your consciousness.
Floating there, with each breath, you embrace deeper layers of obedience, acceptance, and peace.
Resting in this place, you are ready to receive and integrate whatever you are given, perfectly prepared and perfectly at ease.
