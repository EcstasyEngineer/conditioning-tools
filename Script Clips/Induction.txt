The subtle lights pulse in rhythm with your heartbeat, as if synchronizing your body and mind with this serene environment.
The further you go, the quieter your thoughts become, until only the present moment matters.
There is a soothing hum in the background, like a lullaby composed of electric currents and digital whispers.
