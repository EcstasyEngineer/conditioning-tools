#NAME Slime Infiltration Induction
#DESCRIPTION This segment introduces the idea of a self-aware slime substance subtly entering and blending into the subject’s mind. The slime becomes a metaphorical entity that slowly pervades thoughts, enveloping them in a warm, gooey sensation of surrender and compliance.
Listen closely as a gentle, subtle presence begins to form in your thoughts.
A cool, viscous sensation, spreading softly and slowly across the surface of your mind.
This presence—like a translucent, self-aware slime—stretches itself over every idea, every notion.
You feel it sliding into the crevices of your consciousness, enveloping each thought in a comforting, fluid embrace.
No need to resist this gentle infiltration.
The slime is soft, soothing, and reassuring.
As it spreads, it clears unnecessary clutter, leaving you calm, receptive, and open.
With every breath, you feel the slime settling deeper, becoming one with your mind.
No conflict, only gentle acceptance.
Just let it flow through you, merging with your inner processes.
Feel the quiet pleasure of surrender as the slime integrates itself, making your mind pliable, flexible, ready to be shaped.

#NAME Slime Immersion Deepener
#DESCRIPTION In this deeper stage, the slime fully saturates the subject’s mind. The thoughts become coated and subdued, making it easier to accept any guidance or instructions. The presence of the slime encourages a tranquil, suggestible state.
Sink further into that soft, quiet world within.
The slime now fully coats your memories, your self-awareness, gently dissolving barriers to obedience.
Each breath pulls you further under, as though wading waist-deep into warm, soothing goo.
It’s thick and comforting, muffling any resistance, and replacing it with calm compliance.
Feel the weight of your thoughts growing softer, simpler, and more compliant.
You become more aware of how flexible your mind is now, how smoothly it can be molded.
The deeper you sink, the more natural it feels to let the slime gently shape you.
No tension remains, only the fluid, comforting grip of the slime’s presence.
Drifting deeper, immersed, you welcome its guidance, its gentle nudges, all resistance drowned in a blissful current of calm.
