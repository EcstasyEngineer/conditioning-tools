#NAME Maze of Confusion Induction
#DESCRIPTION
This segment places the subject in a mental labyrinth. With each turn, confusion increases, guiding them deeper into a state where higher reasoning fades, replaced by suggestibility.

Imagine a vast maze in your mind.
High walls of thought, endless corridors of swirling ideas.
You walk forward, but each step erodes your certainty.
You can’t quite remember what you were looking for.
Around each corner, thoughts slip through your grasp.
It’s strangely comforting to stop trying so hard, letting the maze guide you instead.
As you wander deeper, your mind grows simpler, more open to suggestion.

#NAME Intellectual Decay Deepener
#DESCRIPTION
Lost inside the mental labyrinth, each attempt to solve it erodes the subject’s intellect further. With diminished reasoning, they accept instructions more readily, becoming docile and easily led.

As you struggle to find a path, ideas slip away.
Complex reasoning fades, leaving pleasant emptiness.
Over and over, each attempt at a solution dulls another sharp edge of your mind.
Soon, you barely think at all—just drift, wait, listen.
The simpler you become, the easier it is to just follow a voice, a command, a suggestion.
No need to solve anything now, just accept and move forward.
Deep in the maze, your resistance dissolves, replaced by calm compliance.
