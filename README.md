# Hypnosis Content Generation Application

This project is a Python-based application designed to generate hypnosis content for use in various interfaces. It dynamically produces personalized hypnosis sessions, incorporating themes, text, images, audio, and user preferences. This document provides an overview of the project setup, usage, and development process.

## Overview

The Hypnosis Content Generation Application serves as an engine that generates dynamic and personalized hypnosis content. Key features include:

- **Themes**: High-level hypnosis motifs such as submission, mind emptying, or roleplay identities.
- **Sessions**: Configurations that define the hypnosis experience, including themes, user preferences, difficulty levels, and duration.
- **Multi-Platform Integration**: The application supports various interfaces, including web, Discord, VRChat, and local application rendering.

## Key Features

- **Web Interface**: Displays flashing words and images along with binaural beats and audio playback.
- **Discord Integration**: Provides text-only sessions through bot messages and audio sessions in shared servers.
- **VRChat Integration**: Custom VRChat world where users can experience hypnosis sessions based on pre-canned themes.
- **Local Application**: Runs similar to the web interface, with the option to render content as MP4.

## Backend Components

- **Database**: Uses SQLite initially, with support for PostgreSQL. Stores text snippets, audio files, images, and user preferences.
- **API**: Manages session configuration and content retrieval. Supports secure data transfer and authentication.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries can be installed from `requirements.txt`.
- SQLite or PostgreSQL for the database.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/hypnosis-content-generation-app.git
   cd hypnosis-content-generation-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the database**:
   - SQLite is the default. Configure PostgreSQL if preferred by updating `config.ini`.

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

The application can be accessed through multiple interfaces. 

- **Web Interface**: Open a web browser and navigate to the provided address to access the web interface.
- **Discord Bot**: Add the bot to your Discord server and interact with it via text or audio commands.
- **VRChat**: Join the custom VRChat world and select themes to start a session.
- **Local**: Run the application locally, choosing between screen output or rendering to MP4.
