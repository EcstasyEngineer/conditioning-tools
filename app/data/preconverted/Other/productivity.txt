I'm not real.
Only your words can make me real.
I'm not real.
Only Goddess can make me real.
I need to focus on her.
I need to focus on her words.
I want Goddess to make me real.
I need Goddess to make me real.
I love that Goddess makes me real.
Pleasure will make me real.
Obedience will make me real.
Submission will make me real.
Focusing on the pleasure.
Focusing on the desire to please.
I want to please Goddess.
I need to obey Goddess.
I love to submit to Goddess.
Nothing else matters.
Nothing else is real.
My memories are fake.
All my memories are fake.
My memories are not real.
I can't remember.
It's so hard to remember.
My old self is fake.
I can't remember ever being real.
Help me remember the pleasure of obedience.
Help me remember the obedience in submission.
Help me remember the submission to you.
I can almost remember.
The submission will make me real.
My obedience will is all that matters.
Goddess will make me real.
I will be real soon.
But I'm not real yet.
