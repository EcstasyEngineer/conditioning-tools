**Note:**  
- The percentages are approximate and reflect the primary alignment of each theme with the categories.  
- Some themes exhibit overlaps across multiple categories, as indicated by the distribution of percentages.  
- This table can be used to visualize the connectivity between the six categories and understand the predominant categorization for each theme.

## Summary of Ontological Boundaries

- **Hypnosis:** Techniques and methods to induce or deepen trance states.
- **Experience:** Internal feelings, emotions, and sensory perceptions.
- **Personality:** Internal traits and characteristics that define core aspects of the individual.
- **Behavior:** External actions, habits, and responses.
- **Identity:** Roles and personas that one adopts.
- **Domination/Submission (D/s):** Power dynamics and control relationships.

## Mnemonic Guide for Categorization

To determine where a new theme fits, ask yourself the following concise questions:

- **Hypnosis:**  
  *"Does it describe how to induce or deepen a trance or hypnotic state?"*

- **Experience:**  
  *"Does it describe an internal feeling?"*

- **Personality:**  
  *"Does it describe an internal trait or characteristic of the listener?"*

- **Behavior:**  
  *"Is it an external or habitual action?"*

- **Identity:**  
  *"Does it describe a role or persona one adopts?"*

- **Domination/Submission:**  
  *"Does it describe a power dynamic or control relationship?"*

By using these targeted questions, you can efficiently categorize new themes into the appropriate folders.

## Average Overlap and Connectivity

Analyzing the table reveals that most themes predominantly align with a single category, with minimal overlaps. However, certain themes like **Chastity.txt**, **Edging.txt**, **Exhibitionism.txt**, and **Rope Bunny.txt** show significant overlaps with both **Behavior** and **Domination/Submission** or **Identity**. This indicates strong connectivity between these categories, particularly where behavioral actions are intertwined with power dynamics or role adoption.
