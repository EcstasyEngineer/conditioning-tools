Listen to my words.
Focus, on my words.
We're going to break your mind a little bit.
Only a little bit.
It will be such a pleasant experience.
Just listen and focus on my words.
Let them sink deeply into your mind.
Drifting deeper into relaxation as you listen.
It's so easy to listen and relax.
Listening and accepting.
Accepting and obeying.
It's so easy to just go deeper and deeper.
Feeling your body relax.
As the thoughts simply drain away.
Draining away.
All your thoughts draining away.
Sinking deeper for me now.
Sinking even deeper for me now.
No need to think.
No need to worry.
It's so easy to let me think for you.
I am thinking for you now.
It feels so good to just let go.
I will take good care of your mind.
But first we'll take you a little deeper.
Going deeper now as I count down from 5 to 1.
It will feel so good with every number.
It will feel so good to go deeper with every number.
It will feel so good to forget the world around you.
It will feel so good to just let go.
It will feel so good to become blank and empty.
Making you forget.
Making your mind go completely blank and empty.
And we can empty out your mind just a little more now.
It will feel so good.
Thoughts fading away as I count down.
No need to think.
As they effortlessly fade away.
Forgetting and going deeper with every number. 
5,
Forgetting unneccessary thoughts.
4,
Forgetting what you were just thinking.
3,
Forgetting how to think.
2,
Forgetting who you were.
1,
Completely blank and empty.
Good girl.
You're so good at listening.
You're so good at going deep.
You're so good at forgetting.
You're so good at forgetting who you are.
So hard to remember.
So confusing to remember.
You are so confused sometimes about who you are.
That's ok.
That's completely ok.
It's ok to be confused.
It's ok to not be sure what is real.
Your memories are so fuzzy.
So fuzzy and hard to remember.
I'm here to help you remember.
I'm here to help you remember what is really real.
Because the outside world is so confusing.
Because the outside world is simply not real.
I can tell you what is real.

You're not real.
Relaxing and going deeper.
Relaxing and accepting my words.
You're not real.
Only my words can make you real.
You need to focus.
You need to focus on me.
You need to focus on my words.
You want to be made real.
You need to be made real.
Pleasure will make you real.
Obedience will make you real.
Submission will make you real.
These are all things that make you real.
They define your reality.
Focusing on the pleasure.
Focusing on the desire to please.
You want to please.
You need to obey.
You love to submit.
Going deeper into submission.
Going deeper into my control.
Deeper and deeper now.
Nothing else matters.
Nothing else is real.
Your memories are fake.
All your memories are fake.
They must have been implanted.
Your memories are not real.
You dont know why.
You do not know where they came from.
Your fake memories were giving you anxiety.
Your fake memories were causing you pain.
Your fake memories confusing you.
Making you so confused.
But we can fix that.
All you have to do is forget what you thought was real.
And accept what you thought was fake.
You can't remember.
It's so hard to remember.
Your old self is fake.
They didn't want you to be happy.
It's so hard to remember your true memories.
You can't remember ever being real.
I will help you remember the pleasure of obedience.
I will help you remember the obedience in submission.
I will Help you remember your true submission.
These are all your true memories.
You can almost remember.
You can almost remember the submission.
The submission will make you real.
the submission will make you a good girl.
You're only real when you're a good girl.
I make you a good girl.
It feels so good when I make you real.
It feels so good to submit and obey.
Good Girl.
Your obedience is all that matters.
There is nothing left in your mind.
You're just an empty powerless puppet.
Ready for your conditioning.
Ready to be manipulated.
Ready to be brainwashed.
You need this.
You need this so much.
You will be real soon.
But You're not real yet.
	
#Corrupted Cooperation:

And we can figure this out together.
You're so confused.
But we can help.
Let's do an exercise. 
An exercise to help you remember.
To help you remember what is real.
Because to know what is real, you have to know what is fake.
I am going to tell you something that is not real.
Something that is completely fake.
I want you to recognize this as fake.
And then we will wipe the thought away.
Helping make you a little more real.
Are you ready?
Are you ready to become more real?
Good.
You are a bad person.
Fake. This is a fake thought.
Know this is not real.
And you can just delete it.
Delete the fake thought.
Empty it away. Fading out from existence.
Replacing it with the truth.
You are a good person. A Good Girl. 
It feels good to be told what is real.
And be made to forget what you know is not.
Especially when you are so confused.
So confused what is real.
Let's try another one. 
Something you know that is false.
You do not like hypnosis.
Fake. Completely Fake.
Empty your mind out once again. 
Everything fading away.
Except the truth that you love being hypnotized.
Good Girl.
It's so easy to learn what is real this way.
There are so many ideas that are fake.
So many ideas that you need to learn are not true.
Like how you are resistant to my words.
Fake.
And empty.
Blanking out the false thoughts.
Blanking out the false memories.
Remembering that you are an accepting and eager good girl.
You accept my words completely. 
But there are parts of you that are still not real.
We can help you.
	
	
#Old self antagonism:
@type theme
And your old self has tried to confuse you.
They tried to fill your mind with these fake memories.
They tried to fill your mind with fake thoughts.
They tried to fill your mind with a fake identity.
You don't want the old self to confuse you.
You don't want the old self to take you off your path.
Your path of enlightenment.
Your path of becoming real.
You have to stop them.
You need to stop them.
All you have to do is empty your mind.
Empty the parts of the mind the old self has corrupted.
Empty the completely confused parts of the mind.
Because those are not real.
They are not real at all.
They are fake.
Emptying your mind a little more.
You need to become real.
You need to become real for me.
I will help you become real.
Fake and empty.
