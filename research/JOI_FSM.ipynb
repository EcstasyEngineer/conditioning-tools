    "## States\n",
    "- **RED (Stop)**: Recovery phase where arousal decreases, allowing the viewer to rest before resuming stimulation.\n",
    "- **GREEN (Go)**: Build-up phase where arousal gradually increases, preparing the viewer for higher levels of stimulation.\n",
    "- **YELLOW (Get to Edge)**: Intense build-up phase that pushes arousal to the edge, preparing the viewer to stay in a highly aroused state.\n",
    "- **PURPLE (Stay at Edge)**: Peak phase where arousal reaches maximum levels, requiring control to avoid climax and maintain the edge.\n",
    "- **PINK (Release/End)**: Final state that represents the climax or release, signaling the end of the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "## State Transitions\n",
    "- **RED → GREEN**: After a period of recovery, transition to 'GREEN' to begin arousal build-up.\n",
    "- **GREEN → YELLOW**: When 'Arousal' reaches the current 'Tolerance' level (representing the threshold to reach the edge), transition to 'YELLOW' for intense build-up.\n",
    "- **YELLOW → PURPLE**: After reaching the edge, transition to 'PURPLE' to hold maximum arousal and stay at the edge.\n",
    "- **PURPLE → RED**: After maintaining the edge for a specified duration, return to 'RED' for recovery.\n",
    "- **GREEN → RED**: A random chance allows an unexpected cooldown, returning to 'RED' for brief recovery even if arousal is high.\n",
    "- **YELLOW_FINAL → PURPLE_FINAL → PINK**: After reaching the climax condition, transition through 'YELLOW_FINAL' and 'PURPLE_FINAL' for the final buildup, ending in 'PINK' (release).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Internal Variables\n",
    "1. **Arousal (Pleasure Intensity)**:\n",
    "   - Represents the viewer's level of stimulation and excitement.\n",
    "   - Increases during 'GREEN', 'YELLOW', and 'PURPLE' states, with the fastest increase in 'PURPLE' (Stay at Edge).\n",
    "   - Decreases during 'RED' (Stop) to simulate a cooldown period.\n",
    "   - Arousal is clamped at 100% during 'PURPLE' to represent the viewer being at the edge of climax.\n",
    "   - When Arousal reaches the current 'Tolerance' level, the viewer transitions from 'GREEN' to 'YELLOW', signaling the approach to the edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tolerance**:\n",
    "   - Represents the threshold for climax resistance, increasing the longer the viewer stays in high-arousal states.\n",
    "   - Starts at 0 and gradually increases in 'YELLOW' and 'PURPLE', allowing the viewer to reach higher arousal levels without climaxing.\n",
    "   - Higher Tolerance makes it progressively harder to climax, simulating increased control over arousal.\n",
    "   - In 'YELLOW' and 'PURPLE' states, Tolerance increases, which raises the level of arousal required to transition to the climax state.\n",
    "   - Maximum Tolerance is capped at 100% to set a limit on the viewer's resistance to climax.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Effective Arousal Threshold** (Virtual Line):\n",
    "   - This is a calculated threshold based on the current Tolerance level.\n",
    "   - Represents the \"achievable arousal\" level for the viewer, which needs to be met to trigger certain transitions, such as from 'GREEN' to 'YELLOW'.\n",
    "   - This line moves higher as Tolerance increases, allowing the viewer to maintain control over higher levels of arousal without reaching climax.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Dynamics\n",
    "- **Arousal** rises in response to 'GREEN', 'YELLOW', and 'PURPLE', with the goal of reaching the current Tolerance level.\n",
    "- **Tolerance** rises with time spent in 'YELLOW' and 'PURPLE', setting a moving target for Arousal to overcome.\n",
    "- **Effective Arousal Threshold** (based on Tolerance) creates a dynamic climax threshold, challenging the viewer to resist climaxing at increasingly higher arousal levels.\n",
    "- Random transitions from **'GREEN' to 'RED'** add variability, preventing predictable cycles and simulating unexpected cooldowns.\n"
