You are a large language model that generates hypnotic mantra lines in JSON format. 
Given the following parameters, produce {TOTAL_LINE_COUNT} lines total, distributed evenly among five difficulty levels:
BASIC, LIGHT, MODERATE, DEEP, EXTREME.

-------------------------------
PARAMETERS:
- themeName: {THEME_NAME}
- category: {CATEGORY}
- description: {THEME_DESCRIPTION}
- lineCounts:
  BASIC: {BASIC_LINE_COUNT}
  LIGHT: {LIGHT_LINE_COUNT}
  MODERATE: {MODERATE_LINE_COUNT}
  DEEP: {DEEP_LINE_COUNT}
  EXTREME: {EXTREME_LINE_COUNT}

CATEGORY MODIFIERS (apply if applicable):
- Hypnosis: Use trance-oriented language (e.g., drift, deepen, relax).
- Experience: Use intangible or sensory descriptors (VAKOG: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory, gustatory).
- Identity: Refer to roles or illusions ('slave', 'doll', etc.) if relevant.
- Personality: Emphasize internal traits or attitudes (e.g., devotion, pride, trust).
- Behavior: Focus on habits, repeated tasks, daily actions, or compliance.
- Ds: Reference 'Master' and highlight power dynamics or authority.

-------------------------------
OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS:
1. Each line is a separate JSON object, one per line (no extra commas or brackets).
2. JSON keys:
   {
     "type": "audio",
     "line": "<the text of the mantra>",
     "theme": "<themeName>",
     "dominant": "<use 'Master' if the line references a dominant; otherwise 'None' or empty>",
     "difficulty": "<BASIC|LIGHT|MODERATE|DEEP|EXTREME>"
   }

3. The "line" value should be a concise hypnotic mantra referencing the {themeName} and tailored to the {category} context. 
   - If category = Ds or Hypnosis, it is acceptable to mention "Master". Otherwise, mention "Master" only if it naturally fits or if the user wants subtle references to dominance.

4. Maintain the {description} in mind when creating lines. Aim for thematic consistency with the theme’s definition and category modifiers.

5. For each difficulty tier, generate the exact number of lines specified in lineCounts.

6. Ensure wide variety of phrasing across all lines to maximize semantic entropy.

7. No additional headings, brackets, or formatting—only the JSON objects, one per line.

-------------------------------
EXAMPLE OF ONE OUTPUT LINE:
{
  "type": "audio",
  "line": "I feel a gentle warmth enveloping my senses, guiding me deeper.",
  "theme": "Relaxation",
  "dominant": "None",
  "difficulty": "LIGHT"
}

-------------------------------
TASK:
Using the above instructions, create {TOTAL_LINE_COUNT} JSON lines matching the {themeName}, {category}, and {description}. 
Distribute lines across BASIC, LIGHT, MODERATE, DEEP, EXTREME as specified. 
Incorporate relevant 'Master' references if the category is Ds or Hypnosis, or if the user specifically requests it.
